# Kintsugi Pixel Dungeon

**Kintsugi Pixel Dungeon** is a fork of **[Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/shatteredpd/)** by **00-Evan**.

Shattered Pixel Dungeon is an open-source traditional roguelike dungeon crawler with randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. It is based on the [source code of Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://watabou.itch.io/).

## About This Fork

**Kintsugi Pixel Dungeon** is an experimental, nostalgia-focused fork.

The goal of this project is **not** to replace or compete with Shattered Pixel Dungeon, but to explore an alternative balance philosophy inspired by earlier versions of the game and long-time player memories.

In this fork:

- Players are intentionally **more powerful**, but progression is still required.
- Many historical nerfs are reverted or re-interpreted.
- Balance and pacing are inspired by older Shattered Pixel Dungeon eras.
- Strength is earned and maintained through upgrades, gold usage, and long-term scaling — not through early-game instant power.
- New mechanics may tie progression, durability, and power directly to gold and item investment.

Think of it as *Shattered Pixel Dungeon, repaired with gold*.

Like **kintsugi** pottery, the game does not hide its history — it reinforces it.  
The cracks are visible, and that’s the point.

This is also my **first public GitHub project**, created as a learning experience and a personal love letter to a game I’ve been playing for nearly a decade.
